Ericsson HDS Agent Platform is a hyperscale datacenter management platform that provides multi-vendor hardware control, high-speed scalable timeseries data collection and powerful interfaces for datacenter operators and developers. Designed to manage environments ranging from the smallest test lab to a hundred-thousand node datacenter, the platform centers around flexible data models constructed on the fly for any data type - metrics, logs, blob data and key-value store. Components written in Go power NodePrime technology to discover inventory, alert on system log events and track performance metrics and hardware changes over time. Data is written as fast as it is delivered in a format that easily integrates with other databases, languages and tools.
